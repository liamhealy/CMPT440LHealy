# Grepy - CMPT440LHealy

## Formal Languages and Computability

### This is the repository for my semester project - 'Grepy'

Project Scope: I will develop a version of the grep utility called grepy using JavaScript. This utility searches files for regular expression pattern matches and produces dot graph file output for the automata used in the matching computation.

### Setup

Editing this project is as easy as opening it in your favorite text editor. I recommend Visual Studio because of the extensions it offers for JavaScript and how beneficial they can be.

### Running the project

Simply open 'index.html'.
